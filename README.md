## Description
This is my portfolio of work and more general site for 'Laura Kane Digital', made using React. The application features a home, contact, services and portfolio page. The application gives 6 examples of my front-end web development work and provides my key contact details. I intend to add more to my 'services' page soon, to provide details of the other digital marketing services I provide, such as social media and email marketing. 

Using React to create this application was challenging, particularly when trying to deploy to GitHub pages using React Router. I had to use a number of workarounds and try a lot of different things to get all my elements to render correctly and the routes to all work correctly.
