    <h1>Welcome to my portfolio site.</h1>
        <p>Hi. I'm a London-based freelance social media manager, email designer, and front-end web developer. I have 5 years' experience of copywriting, email design, and content creation. I've recently completed a course in front-end web development meaning I can now also offer website design. Please take a look at my portfolio of work, and if you like what you see, get in touch.</p>
